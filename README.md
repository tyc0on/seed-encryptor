# Seed Encryptor

**Encrypt BIP39 seed phrases into compact, base36-encoded strings for secure and stamp-friendly backups.**

---

## Features

- **Strong Encryption**: Uses AES-GCM with Scrypt key derivation for robust security.
- **Compact Format**: Converts encrypted data into a short, human-readable base36 string, ideal for physical backups.
- **BIP39 Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with standard BIP39 wordlists.
- **Backup-Friendly**: Designed to create backups suitable for stamps, QR codes, or small physical tokens.

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run the script directly from the command line:

```bash
python seed_encryptor.py
```

### Modes

- **Encrypt**: Converts BIP39 seed phrases into an encrypted base36 string.
- **Decrypt**: Restores the original BIP39 seed phrases from the encrypted string.

### Command-Line Interaction

1. **Encryption**:
   - Input a seed phrase.
   - Provide a password.
   - Receive a base36-encoded string.

2. **Decryption**:
   - Input the base36 string.
   - Provide the correct password.
   - Retrieve the original seed phrase.

## Examples

### Encryption

Input:
```text
Encrypt or Decrypt? [E/D]: E
Password: ********
Enter words: apple banana cherry date elderberry fig grape
```

Output:
```text
Encrypted Base36 Ciphertext:
3p4h7xtz6wry2mk9b5jf0nqvl8g1d
```

### Decryption

Input:
```text
Encrypt or Decrypt? [E/D]: D
Password: ********
Base36 ciphertext: 3p4h7xtz6wry2mk9b5jf0nqvl8g1d
```

Output:
```text
Decrypted Seed Phrase:
apple banana cherry date elderberry fig grape
```
